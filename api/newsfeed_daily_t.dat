<HEADLINE><![CDATA[1-800-662-HELP: Too Few Opioid Users Aware of Lifesaving Helpline]]></HEADLINE>
<BLURB><![CDATA[]]></BLURB>
<BYLINE><![CDATA[<b>By Steven Reinberg</b><br><i>HealthDay Reporter</i>]]></BYLINE>
<BODY><![CDATA[<p>MONDAY, Jan. 14, 2019 (HealthDay News) -- Millions of Americans are living with drug addiction, but a free, national hotline that offers help is underused because most don't know about it, new research finds.</p>

<p>After the popular singer Demi Lovato was hospitalized in July, researchers found that although her suspected heroin overdose was widely written about, little mention was made of the drug abuse helpline. It is funded by the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).</p>

<p>"1-800-662-HELP is a place for those needing help to navigate through a sea of complex treatment options to arrive at the choice that best meets their needs, finances and location," explained lead researcher John Ayers.  He is an adjunct associate professor in the division of infectious diseases and global public health, at  the University of California, San Diego.</p>

<p>People who call 1-800-662-HELP (4357) are given a list of centers in their area that can best meet their treatment and financial needs.</p>

<p>According to SAMHSA, the helpline received more than 68,000 calls per month in the first quarter of 2018. In 2017, more than 815,000 people called the helpline.</p>

<p>People without insurance who call the helpline are referred to state offices that can guide them to state-funded programs. The helpline can also refer people to centers that charge on a sliding-fee scale or accept Medicare or Medicaid.</p>

<p>People with private health insurance are encouraged to contact their insurer for a list of participating health care providers and facilities.</p>

<p>Ayers and his colleagues looked at how many media mentions of the helpline occurred in the week after Lovato's overdose.</p>

<p>For comparison, the researchers looked at how many mentions of a suicide hotline were made in the media in the week following the suicide of the chef Anthony Bourdain in June 2018.</p>

<p>Although after Lovato's overdose the discussion of opioids or heroin on Twitter was a hot topic among both reporters and the public,  little mention was made of the addiction helpline.</p>

<p>For example, only 216 of the 42,500 news reports found on Google News mentioning Lovato and the 25,300 news reports mentioning opioids or heroin cited the helpline.</p>

<p>The pattern was the same on Twitter, where out of nearly 1 million posts about Lovato, only 258 mentioned the helpline, the findings showed.</p>

<p>After Bourdain's suicide, however, the researchers found nearly 5,000 Google News stories, 21,000 tweets and 29,000 searches for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.</p>

<p>According to Fred Muench, president and CEO of the Partnership for Drug-Free Kids, "The SAMHSA helpline is not as well disseminated as the [other] helplines. Substance abuse doesn't get the same attention as suicide."</p>

<p>Suicide is a concern that needs immediate action, while treating drug addiction is an ongoing journey, he added. </p>

<p>"By calling the helpline they might talk to someone, but getting treatment takes a while," Muench said. "Just because you're referred doesn't mean you are going to get treatment." </p>

<p>Muench said barriers to treatment include the ability to pay, waiting times and the quality of treatment. Unlike the immediacy of the threat of suicide, treating drug abuse takes years.</p>

<p>"There's not enough treatment available," he said, "but at least the helpline is a place to start." For Muench, the bottom line is to call the helpline, but if that doesn't help -- keep going.</p>

<p>Ayers believes that news stories should include the drug helpline number in all the stories they do about the opioid addiction crisis.</p>

<p>Reporters covering drugs should include 1-800-662-HELP in their stories, media outlets should  showcase the helpline, and the federal government should invest in strategies to increase awareness of the helpline, Ayers suggested.</p>

<p>The report was published online Jan. 14 in the journal <i>JAMA Internal Medicine</i>. </p>

<p> Dr. Harshal Kirane is director of addiction services at Staten Island University Hospital in New York City. He said, "A very small percentage of people in our country struggling with addiction are accessing care." </p>

<p>Although the helpline can be effective, he noted,  if it's like other referral services, very few of the callers actually connect with treatment services. That disconnect reflects the limitations of the health care system to treat drug addiction. </p>

<p> "Resources are not readily available or appealing, and there is a stigma of going to an addiction treatment center," Kirane said. </p>

<p>Kirane agreed that the media should promote the SAMHSA helpline. </p>

<p>If more people knew about the helpline and calls increased dramatically, it would show the demand for addiction treatment, and services might increase, he said.</p>

<HEADLINE><![CDATA[Opioids Now More Deadly for Americans Than Traffic Accidents]]></HEADLINE>
<BLURB><![CDATA[]]></BLURB>
<BYLINE><![CDATA[]]></BYLINE>
<BODY><![CDATA[<p>MONDAY, Jan. 14, 2019 (HealthDay News) -- For the first time in history, Americans' risk of dying from an opioid overdose is higher than their risk of dying in a car accident, the National Safety Council reported Monday.</p>

<p>The chances of dying from an accidental opioid overdose in the United States are now 1 in 96, compared to a 1 in 103 risk of dying in a traffic crash, according to the new analysis of preventable deaths in the council's <i>Injury Facts</i> publication.</p>

<p>The opioid crisis is the reason why opioid overdoses are now at the top of the list, and that crisis is worsening with an influx of illicit fentanyl, according to the council.</p>

<p>The analysis of U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data also shows that falls are the third leading cause of preventable deaths in the United States, with a lifetime risk of 1 in 114, an increase from 1 in 119 a few years ago.</p>

<p>Preventable injuries are the third leading cause of death in the United States, claiming 169,936 lives in 2017. Heart disease and cancer are the two leading causes of death.</p>

<p>Of the three leading causes of death, preventable injuries were the only category with an increase in 2017, according to the council.</p>

<p>A person's lifetime risk of dying from any preventable, accidental cause is 1 in 25, compared with 1 in 30 in 2004.</p>

<p>Other new data in the report show that bicycle deaths rose 28 percent in 2016; sports and recreational injuries disproportionately affect youngsters aged 5 to 14; most fatal falls occur in December and January; men are more likely than women to die from preventable causes; and preventable deaths far outnumber intentional deaths.</p>

<p>"We've made significant strides in overall longevity in the United States, but we are dying from things typically called accidents at rates we haven't seen in half a century," said Ken Kolosh, manager of statistics at the council.</p>

<p>"We cannot be complacent about 466 lives lost every day. This new analysis reinforces that we must consistently prioritize safety at work, at home and on the road to prevent these dire outcomes," he said in a council news release.</p>

<HEADLINE><![CDATA[Parents Often Unaware of Kids' Suicidal Thoughts]]></HEADLINE>
<BLURB><![CDATA[]]></BLURB>
<BYLINE><![CDATA[<b>By Amy Norton</b><br><i>HealthDay Reporter</i>]]></BYLINE>
<BODY><![CDATA[<p>MONDAY, Jan. 14, 2019 (HealthDay News) -- When children are having suicidal thoughts, their parents may often be in the dark, a new study shows.</p>

<p>The study included more than 5,000 kids, aged 11 to 17, and one parent for each child. Researchers found that among the children, 8 percent said they had contemplated suicide at some time. But only half of their parents were aware of it.</p>

<p>The same gap showed up when researchers looked at the issue from a different angle: Around 8 percent of parents said their child had ever thought about suicide.</p>

<p>Almost half the time, the child denied it, according to findings published online Jan. 14 in <i>Pediatrics</i>.</p>

<p>It all points to a "pretty substantial disagreement" between parents' and kids' reports, said study leader Jason Jones, a research scientist at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.</p>

<p>In cases where parents are unaware of their child's struggles, one reason may simply be that the signs were not obvious, according to Jones.</p>

<p>"It's often difficult to know what's going on in someone else's mind," he said.</p>

<p>That's not to say there are no warning signs of suicide risk, Jones pointed out.</p>

<p>Some of those red flags include withdrawal from friends, family and activities; sleeping too much or too little; irritable or aggressive behavior; and giving away possessions, according to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention.</p>

<p>Still, it can be tough for parents to discern when their own kids are having suicidal thoughts, a San Francisco emergency doctor agreed. </p>

<p>And even when signs are there, parents' minds may resist the possibility, according to Dr. Jacqueline Grupp-Phelan, head of pediatric emergency at the University of California, San Francisco's Benioff Children's Hospital.</p>

<p>"Sometimes they don't want to acknowledge the problem because it's so scary," she said.</p>

<p>That's why it's important to screen kids for depression and suicide risk, and direct families to help, according to Grupp-Phelan, who co-authored an editorial published with the study.</p>

<p>Depression is a major risk factor for suicide -- and up to 20 percent of teenagers suffer depression at some point, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). Earlier this year, the AAP issued updated guidelines urging pediatricians to routinely screen adolescents aged 12 and older for depression, using standard questionnaires during annual checkups.</p>

<p>To identify those who are at risk of suicide, screening needs to ask specifically about it, Grupp-Phelan said. Not all depressed kids think about suicide, and those who are suicidal do not always have depression, she pointed out.</p>

<p>The new findings are based on 5,137 kids from Philadelphia. They and their parents were asked the same questions -- delving into whether they (or their child) had ever thought about suicide, or had ever "thought a lot about death or dying."</p>

<p>Thinking about death does not necessarily mean a child is suicidal, Jones said. But it can signal distress or depression.</p>

<p>Overall, about 9 percent of girls and 7 percent of boys said they'd contemplated suicide. Only half of parents were aware of it, the findings showed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, just over 15 percent of both boys and girls said they'd thought about death often. Parents were unaware about three-quarters of the time, according to the report.</p>

<p>Then there were the cases where parents believed their kids had contemplated suicide, but the child denied it.</p>
 
<p>A few things could be going on, Jones said. The child may be in denial. Or parents may have misread something in their child's behavior. In some cases, parents and kids may have interpreted the survey questions differently.</p>

<p>Both Jones and Grupp-Phelan stressed the importance of open communication between parents and kids.</p>

<p>"Have a safe and supportive home environment where your kids know they can come forward with any problems they're having," Jones said.</p>

<p>And Grupp-Phelan suggested, "Ask your kids about how they're feeling. Make sure they know that you're there for them, no matter what."</p>

<p>If parents are concerned about mental health issues, she said, talking to their pediatrician is a good place to start. There are also 24-hour helplines, she note, such as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org).</p>

<HEADLINE><![CDATA[Many Teens, Young Adults Don't Get Private Time With Doctors]]></HEADLINE>
<BLURB><![CDATA[]]></BLURB>
<BYLINE><![CDATA[]]></BYLINE>
<BODY><![CDATA[<p>MONDAY, Jan. 14, 2019 (HealthDay News) -- Having confidential talks with a health care provider is important for teens and young adults, but they rarely get the chance to do so, a new study finds.</p>

<p>"Discussing confidentiality and having private time with a provider are critical components of comprehensive clinical preventive services for young people, however about half of young people report never having had these with their provider," said lead author Stephanie Grilo. She's a doctoral candidate in sociomedical sciences at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health in New York City.</p>

<p>"Regular providers need to begin discussion of private time and confidentiality at earlier ages," Grilo added in a university news release.</p>

<p>In the study, the researchers analyzed data from more than 1,900 respondents, aged 13 to 26, who took part in a 2016 nationwide online survey.</p>

<p>Overall, only 55 percent of females said they'd ever had private time with their health care provider or a confidential discussion. Among males, the rates were 49 percent for having private time and 44 percent for a confidential discussion.</p>

<p>Among 13- and 14-year-olds, 22 percent of girls and 14 percent of boys had ever had private time with a health care provider. Among young adults, only 68 percent of women and 61 percent of men had ever had private time with their health care provider.</p>

<p>Authors of the study, published Jan. 9 in the <i>Journal of Adolescent Health</i>, said professional guidelines recommend that teens and young adults have access to confidential services and opportunities to talk privately with their provider without a parent or someone else in the room.</p>

<p>Female health care providers were more likely to initiate discussions with young women but not with young men, the study found.</p>

<p>It also found that teens and young adults who were sexually active had higher rates of private time or discussing confidentiality. Researchers said this suggests providers are more likely to initiate such actions with young patients involved in risky behaviors.</p>

<p>Patients who had had private time and/or confidentiality discussions had more positive attitudes about their provider and preventive services such as vaccinations, screening and counseling, according to the study.</p>

<p>"The gap between clinical recommendations and practice means there is a need for education of parents, providers and adolescents on the importance of private time and confidentiality for adolescent and young adult care," Grilo said. "Private time and confidentiality can enhance preventive care for young people in the United States."</p>

<HEADLINE><![CDATA[AHA: Why Do IVF Pregnancies With Frozen Embryos Raise Preeclampsia Risk?]]></HEADLINE>
<BLURB><![CDATA[]]></BLURB>
<BYLINE><![CDATA[]]></BYLINE>
<BODY><![CDATA[<p>MONDAY, Jan. 14, 2019 (American Heart Association) -- For women who use in vitro fertilization to get pregnant, particularly those who find success with frozen embryo transfers, recent studies have found they have an increased risk of preeclampsia, a pregnancy complication and serious blood pressure condition. </p> 

<p>Now, academic researchers may have uncovered why.</p> 

<p>"Many have reported this higher incidence of preeclampsia in those undergoing frozen embryo transfer, but without any explanation. Now we think we have an explanation  they have no corpus luteum," said Dr. Kirk Conrad, co-senior author of the study published Monday in the American Heart Association journal <i>Hypertension</i>.</p> 

<p>The corpus luteum is a collection of cells that forms in the ovary after ovulation. It produces multiple hormones that help both maintain pregnancy and the body's adjustment to it.</p> 

<p>Women who undergo frozen embryo transfer -- an increasingly used fertility option -- usually do so under a "programmed cycle" involving medical suppression of reproductive hormones, which ultimately prevents the corpus luteum from developing.</p> 

<p>One way to prevent this from happening is for women to instead undergo a "modified" natural cycle that would allow a corpus luteum to develop, said Conrad, a professor in the University of Florida's departments of physiology and function genomics and obstetrics and gynecology.</p> 

<p>Researchers found that preeclampsia rates reached 12.8 percent in women receiving frozen embryos under a programmed cycle without a corpus luteum compared with 3.9 percent among women who had frozen embryo transfers under a modified natural cycle with a corpus luteum.</p> 

<p>Women without a corpus luteum lacked relaxin, one of the hormones it produces during pregnancy. The hormone helps relax blood vessels, among other things, said Dr. Afshan Hameed, a cardiologist and high-risk obstetrician who was not associated with the study. </p> 

<p>Women who lack relaxin "are at high risk because their blood vessels may remain stiff as shown in the study, particularly the aorta," said Hameed, a professor of cardiology and obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California, Irvine.</p> 

<p>"The researchers hypothesize that relaxin may play a role in those stiff vessels that are (common) earlier on in pregnancy, and that translates to preeclampsia later on in the pregnancy," she said. "But there are many other hormones present in the system that cause the blood vessels to constrict or dilate, and we don't have any data on those vasoactive type of hormones in this study."</p> 

<p>Conrad agreed the study only provides an association between a missing corpus luteum, absent relaxin and increased preeclampsia, not a direct link. "The corpus luteum makes a lot of products that we don't know about that may also be important," he said.</p> 

<p>Even so, Conrad called the findings "compelling."</p> 

<p>He said the study's co-senior author Dr. Valerie Baker is designing a randomized clinical trial to examine frozen embryo transfers in a natural or modified natural cycle with a corpus luteum versus a programmed cycle with no corpus luteum.</p> 

<p>Fresh embryo transfers come with a greater risk for babies with low birth weight and who are small for their gestational age, Conrad said. Frozen embryo transfers seem to lessen those risks -- but then add a higher risk for preeclampsia.</p> 

<p>"I think the way to address this whole problem would be to do the frozen embryo transfer in a modified natural cycle or eventually replace the missing corpus luteal factors," he said. "It would be a nice solution but clearly needs (more research) before anything can be done."</p>

<HEADLINE><![CDATA[Gay Dads and Their Kids Still Face Social Shaming]]></HEADLINE>
<BLURB><![CDATA[]]></BLURB>
<BYLINE><![CDATA[<b>By Alan Mozes</b><br><i>HealthDay Reporter</i>]]></BYLINE>
<BODY><![CDATA[<p>MONDAY, Jan. 14, 2019 (HealthDay News) -- Two-thirds of gay fathers have felt the pain of social stigma, and they have encountered that stigma most often in religious settings, a new survey shows.</p>

<p>"We were not surprised that stigma is still experienced by gay fathers," said study author Dr. Ellen Perrin. "But we did not expect so much stigma to be experienced in religious settings."</p>

<p>In an anonymous survey of 732 American gay fathers spread across 47 states, researchers found that 63.5 percent said they had been shamed, hurt, excluded or made to feel uncomfortable in the prior year. Nearly one in five said their children had at times shied away from socializing out of anxiety that they would also encounter social stigma.</p>

<p>The survey also found that more than one-third of gay dads came up against social stigma at religious gatherings, making it the most common place where they were made to feel uncomfortable or shunned as parents.</p> 

<p>Perrin, a professor of developmental-behavioral pediatrics with the Floating Hospital for Children and Tufts University's School of Medicine in Boston, stressed the findings were solely a snapshot of how stigma plays out among today's gay fathers.</p>

<p>Nor would she venture a guess as to whether the degree of stigma being experienced by gay fathers today is also felt by lesbian parents.</p>

<p>"In general, some people think that there is more stigma about gay men as fathers than lesbian women as mothers," Perrin acknowledged. "But this is not a part of our study."</p>

<p>Still, Perrin pointed out that stigma risk held steady across all kinds of social boundaries. "We did not find any differences in terms of rural or urban settings, racial composition of the family, or socioeconomic status of the family," she said.</p>

<p> Gay fathers did, however, report that they were less likely to experience such parent-related stigma if they resided in states where more same-sex legal protections were in place.</p>

<p>The study participants were gay men heading households that in sum cared for more than 1,300 children (average age of  13).</p>

<p>Nearly 40 percent of the children were born out of a heterosexual relationship, while a little over one-third became family members through adoption or foster care. Surrogacy was the birth method for about 14 percent of the kids.</p>

<p>Beyond religious settings, about one-quarter of the dads said stigma emanated from members of their family, neighbors or even their gay friends. An equal number reported being discriminated against by people they didn't know, such as waiters, service providers and sales clerks.</p>

<p>The researchers concluded that "despite encouraging legal and social changes, gay men and their children still face stigma and discrimination."</p>

<p>Looking ahead, Perrin suggested that reducing the risk for such stigma would most likely require making greater efforts to counteract discrimination through education and more "opportunities for interaction" between heterosexuals and gay couples.</p>

<p>Perrin and her colleagues reported their findings online Jan. 14 in the journal <i>Pediatrics</i>.</p>


<p>Abbie Goldberg is director of the women's and gender studies program at Clark University in Worcester, Mass. She pointed out that the concept of gay fatherhood is still "new" for some people.</p>

<p>"Many people, particularly older adults, grew up at a time when gay fatherhood was not visible or even seen as a possibility," Goldberg said. "Gay dads still face the stigma that men are inadequate parents when compared to mothers, who are seen as more 'innately' nurturing, and so on," she added.</p>

<p>"Plus, despite it being fallacious, the old stereotype of gay men as pedophiles still creeps into some people's consciousness when they are evaluating the viability and desirability of gay fathers," Goldberg noted.</p>

<p>Still, she said it should be recognized that in all likelihood some gay dads -- particularly those who are wealthy and/or white -- do have an easier go of it than others. Why? Because they have greater ability to sidestep stigma risk by moving to more progressive communities, and/or by sending their children to more progressive schools.</p>

<p>"Privilege often means choice," Goldberg said. "And white gay dads with money are more mobile. They have more options."</p>

<HEADLINE><![CDATA[Happiness High in States With Lots of Parks, Libraries]]></HEADLINE>

<BODY><![CDATA[<p>MONDAY, Jan. 14, 2019 (HealthDay News) -- The number of parks, libraries and natural resources in the state where you reside might have a great deal to do with how happy you are.</p>

<p>New research suggests that Americans who live where more money is spent on these "public goods" are happier than their counterparts in other states.</p>

<p>"Public goods are things you can't exclude people from using -- and one person using them doesn't stop another from doing so," explained study author Patrick Flavin. He's an associate professor of political science at Baylor University in Waco, Texas.</p>

<p>"They're typically not profitable to produce in the private market, so if the government doesn't provide them, they will either be under-provided or not at all," he added in a university news release.</p>

<p>Other types of public goods include highways and police protection, the researchers said.</p>

<p>In the study, Flavin and his colleagues analyzed data on more than 26,000 Americans' self-reported levels of happiness collected between 1976 and 2006. </p>

<p>While the study only found an association between happiness and public goods, higher spending on these goods make communities "more livable, with more amenities," Flavin said. </p>
<p>"If roads are completed and kept up, so that people aren't stuck in traffic, they have more time to do things they enjoy doing. Large parks are social spaces -- and one clear finding of happiness studies is that people who are more socially connected tend to be happier," he noted.</p>

<p>Public goods also tend to increase home values, and "while higher property taxes generally accompany higher home values, it seems that the good outweighs the unfortunate part about having to pay higher taxes," Flavin added.</p>

<p>Spending on public goods provides benefits across income, education, gender and race/ethnicity lines, and has support across the political spectrum, according to the researchers.</p>

<p>"Compared to a lot of the other government spending, public goods tend to be less controversial between liberals and conservatives, Democrats and Republicans, compared to poverty assistance or unemployment benefits, where there is definite disagreement between political parties," Flavin said.</p>

<p>"I think there is less political conflict over public goods spending simply because if the government doesn't provide them, they won't be provided at all," he said.</p>
<p>The study was published recently in the journal <i>Social Science Research</i>. </p>

<BODY><![CDATA[<p>MONDAY, Jan. 14, 2019 (HealthDay News) -- Getting kids to try new foods can become a daily showdown. One promising approach: expose babies early on to varied tastes and textures.</p>

<p>Researchers in Brisbane, Australia, found that food experiences when just 14 months old can influence the eating habits that children will exhibit at age 3. And introducing a variety of fruits and vegetables and other types of foods early on is key to a better diet quality later on.</p>

<p>The result: A child who eats more than just chicken fingers and cheese sticks.</p>

<p>For the purpose of the study, the children were exposed to 55 different food items. The researchers found that having a great number of vegetables, fruits and other foods at age 14 months predicted more varied food preferences, higher food intake and less fussiness when the children's eating habits were re-evaluated at 3.7 years of age.</p>

<p>Babies can start eating solid food at about 6 months. Once they reach this milestone, don't hesitate to offer a wide variety of healthy foods in a variety of textures. Ask your pediatrician for guidelines if you're unsure of the best foods or how to prepare them.</p>

<p>Your baby may already show a preference for one or two foods, but don't let his or her responses deter you -- keep introducing others. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, it can take up to 15 tries before a child actually accepts a new food.</p>

<p>Also, try different cooking methods. For instance, one day steam carrots. Another day, mash them. Offer different shapes, too, from shreds to slivers. A healthy dip can also make eating more fun.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that young children model parents' behavior so you should enjoy the same wide variety of foods as you serve them.</p>

<BODY><![CDATA[<p>MONDAY, Jan. 14, 2019 (HealthDay News) -- If you have children, you know how important it is to keep up with their immunization schedule.</p>

<p>But getting vaccines and booster shots is vital throughout adulthood as well.</p>

<p>The most common adult shot is the yearly flu vaccine, recommended for just about every adult. Some fight three flu strains, others, four.</p>

<p>However, there's more to do.</p>

<p>You might not realize that you should have a tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis (or Tdap) booster every 10 years. Pertussis, better known as whooping cough, has been making a comeback because not enough people have been getting re-immunized.</p>

<p>And if you didn't have chickenpox or the varicella vaccine as a child, you're a candidate for the two-dose immunization.</p>

<p>Other recommended vaccines:</p>

<p>Women up to age 26 should have the HPV vaccine; it's given to men up to age 21, and under some circumstances, up to 26. The newest version protects against nine types of the human papillomavirus, the ones most heavily associated with cancers, such as cervical cancer.</p>

<p>Depending on your age and the type of measles-mumps-rubella vaccine you were given as a child, you might be a candidate for a two-dose MMR vaccination.</p>

<p>Some other shots are specifically intended for people age 50 and over, such as the zoster vaccines, designed to help you avoid shingles, a very painful reactivation of chickenpox virus.</p>

<p>Those 65 and older are encouraged to get vaccines that protect against many strains of pneumonia. Depending on your health status, you may benefit from getting pneumonia vaccines at an earlier age, along with meningitis and hepatitis vaccines.</p>

<p>There are also special recommendations for pregnant women and world travelers, depending on your destination. Be sure to talk to your doctor about your individual needs.</p>

<p><b>More information</b></p>

<p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a detailed chart on <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/downloads/adult/adult-combined-schedule.pdf" target="_new">essential vaccinations</a> for men and women of all ages.</p>

<BODY><![CDATA[<p>Here are some of the latest health and medical news developments, compiled by the editors of HealthDay:</p>


<p><span class="subhead"><b>Trump Rules on Employer-Provided Birth Control Blocked by Judge</b></span></p>

<p>The Trump administration's new rules on employer-provided birth control have been blocked in some parts of the country by a judge in California.</p>

<p>The preliminary injunction against the rules allowing more companies to opt out of providing female employees with no-cost birth control apply to 13 states and Washington, D.C., the <i>Associated Press</i> reported.</p>

<p>Judge Haywood Gilliam ruled on Sunday in favor of plaintiffs seeking to prevent the rules from taking effect as scheduled on Monday while a lawsuit against them is before the courts.</p>

<p>However, Gilliam rejected the plaintiffs' request to block the rules nationwide, the <i>AP</i> reported.</p>

<p>The ruling applies to California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and the District of Columbia.</p>

<p>-----</p>

<p><span class="subhead"><b>U.S. Doctor Released From Omaha Hospital After Ebola Monitoring</b></span></p>

<p>An American doctor who was monitored for 21 days after possible Ebola exposure did not develop the deadly disease and has been released from the Nebraska Medicine  Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, officials say.</p>

<p>The unidentified doctor's possible exposure to Ebola occurred in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where there is an Ebola outbreak.</p>

<p>"This person completed the required 21-day monitoring period and did not develop symptoms of the disease," Dr. Ted Cieslak, and infectious diseases specialist and associate professor of epidemiology, University of Nebraska Medical Center College of Public Health, said in a medical center news release.</p>

<p>"Because this individual was symptom-free throughout the monitoring period, it was determined they did not have Ebola, and therefore, were free to depart our facility and return home," Cieslak said.</p>

<p>The doctor arrived at the medical center for monitoring on Dec. 29. and was kept in a secure area not accessible to other patients or the public. After leaving the medical center on Jan. 12, the doctor left Omaha.</p>
